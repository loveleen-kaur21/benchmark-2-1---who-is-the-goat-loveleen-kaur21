          <h3>Background</h3>
          At just four years old, Kaur immigrated with her family from Punjab,
          India to Brampton, Canada. Being a kid in Canada, where she did not
          know the English language as well as others, felt a lot more lonely.
          Without friends, she came to love reading books. Following the steps
          of her mother, she began to draw and paint at the age of 5 up until
          the age of 17. Soon, she began to have a passion for writing and
          performing instead. Kaur recieved fame on Instagram and Tumblr through
          sharing her short visual poetry. Her work is made from the inspiration
          of Sikh scripture.<br />

          </h4>
          In 2014, when Kaur was 21 and still a university student, she wrote,
          illustrated, and self-published her first poetry collection, milk and
          honey. This collection has sold two and a half million copies
          internationally. <i>milk and honey</i> is a collection of poetry and
          prose about survival, violence, abuse, love, loss, and feminity.
          Divided into four chapters, each part serves a specific purpose. A
          famous quote from the book itself: "<i
            >the world gives you so much pain and here you are making gold out
            of it - there is nothing purer than that</i
          >"<br />

          </h5>
          In 2017, Kaur published her second collection of poetry:
          <i>The Sun and Her Flowers</i>. It is divided into five chapters with
          illustrations drawn by herself. Following the debut of
          <i>milk and honey</i>, Kaur found it difficult to find this book to
          meet her higher expectations. The goal throughout the writing process
          focused on "the corrective experience" that occurs in unhealthy
          relationships. A lot of the book is showing the message to love
          yourself and live life to its best. Since June 2018, the book has sold
          over three million copies and has been translated into more than 35
          languages. A famous quote from the book itself: “<i
            >what is the greatest lesson a woman should learn that since day one
            she's already had everything she needs within herself it's the world
            that convinced her she did not</i
          >”

          <h6>Impact</h6>
          In the world of the 21st century, women are still fighting chauvinism.
          Kaur's work and message has become widely famous for young women to
          fight against this and succeed. The core of her work is human dignity.
          Personal growth and global growth is still a challenge everyone in
          this world is facing. Kaur shares stories with us that allows us to
          know that we are not alone in this. She teaches us that this journey
          of growth can be and fighting challenges can be hard, but it can be
          done. Kaur is empowering women to climb those mountains higher. Kaur
          has recieved criticism for her work being too "simplistic". Instead,
          Kaur wanted to do something more accessable. She justifies her reason
          for this: “I’ve realized, it’s not the exact content that people
          connect with. People will understand and they’ll feel it because it
          all just goes back to the human emotion. Sadness looks the same across
          all cultures, races, and communities. So does happiness and joy.” She
          has worked with others to endorse, perform, and lead, including
          Canadian Member of Parliament, Jagmeet Singh.
